  Gatsby Portfolio Starter
</h1>

This is a Gatsby implementation of [Start Bootstrap's Creative] (https://startbootstrap.com/previews/creative/) template based on [**John J Kerry's Gatsby starter**](https://johnjkerr.github.io/gatsby-creative).

## âœ¨ Features

- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io)
- [Start Bootstrap Creative](https://startbootstrap.com/previews/creative)
- [React Scrollspy](https://github.com/makotot/react-scrollspy)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

0. **Make sure you have the basics.**

    ***Node.js***
    In order to use this template, you need to have node.js installed. Run `node -v` on the command line, and if a version is displayed, you're good to go. If not, check out Gatsby's instructions on the [**appropriate installation**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#install-nodejs-for-your-appropriate-operating-system) for your machine.

    ***Git***
    If you don't have Git, get it using [**these instructions**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#install-git).

    ***Gatsby CLI***
    You'll need to install this node.js package globally, with `npm install -g gatsby-cli`. Once it's installed, view the available commands by running `gatsby --help`.

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**
    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the starter project.
    
    ```sh
    gatsby new <your-project-name> https://github.com/doubledherin/portfolio-website-starter.git
    ```

    This will create a new Gatsby project based on a clone of this repo.

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd <your-project-name>
    gatsby develop
    ```

    You'll see that Git is already initialized in your repo. To push to Github, create a new repository on Github and then add it as the origin remote locally with `git remote add origin <url-of-your-github-repo>`. 

    Make your first commit and push with 
    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push -f origin master
    ```

    You should only need the `-f` (force push) tag the first push.

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is GraphiQL, a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `<your-project-name>` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

    Hot reloading is hot hot hot.

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.

## ðŸ’« Deployment to Github Pages

You have 2 choices for Github deployment: 
- your github.io subdomain (e.g. `<username>.github.io`) or 
- a github.io path of your subdomain (e.g. `<username>.github.io/<pathPrefix>`)

### Deployment to your github.io subdomain
1. In your Github repo, click Settings, scroll down to Github Pages, and select `master` for your source page. Also select a Jekyll theme, even though we're not using one.
2. In your `package.json`, under `scripts`, add a new entry: `"deploy": "gatsby build && gh-pages -d public -b master"`
3. Run `npm run deploy` and you should see the site at `username.github.io`.
4. If you'd like, remove the `pathPrefix` entry in the `gatsby-config.js` file, as it's only needed for deployment to a specific path.

### Deployment to a github.io path
1. Create a local `gh-pages` branch and push it to Github. Also select a Jekyll theme, even though we're not using one.
2. In your Github repo, click Settings, scroll down to Github Pages, and select `gh-pages` for your source page.
3. In the `gatsby-config.js` file, change the `pathPrefix` entry to be the name of your repo. (By default, it's set to `/my-portfolio`.)
4. In your `package.json`, under `scripts`, add a new entry: `"deploy": "gatsby build --prefix-paths && gh-pages -d public"`
5. Run `npm run deploy` and you should see the site at `<username>.github.io/<pathPrefix>`.

## ðŸ’« Deployment to Other Nice Places
If you're interested in hosting your  site somewhere other than Github Pages, check out the [**Gatsby docs**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploying-and-hosting/). There are tons of options.
